# cw-app

This is a React app built on top of
[React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate).

## Building
For convenience, we're presently building production JS
and committing it directly to the
[Clinwiki Rails project code](https://github.com/clinwiki-org/clinwiki).

```bash
./scripts/build
```

## Tests
```bash
yarn test
```
